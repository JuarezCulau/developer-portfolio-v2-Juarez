I've worked on an exciting open-source project where I developed the MABA (Mice Automatic Behavior Analysis) tool. This bioinformatic tool utilizes deep-learning models to extract visual behavior data from mice in neuroscience research. As an Unreal Developer, I've also had the opportunity to create gameplay systems, optimize physics systems, and design 2D and 3D games using Unreal Engine 4 and 5. Additionally, I've contributed to AI development, enhancing character behaviors to create immersive gaming experiences."
